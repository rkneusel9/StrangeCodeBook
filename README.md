## Errata

Nothing is perfect.  Bugs in the book show up here:

- Equation 4.2 has an extra term in it.  It should be $$x_{i+1} \leftarrow \frac{1}{2}\left(x_i + \frac{n}{x_i}\right)$$.
- On page 153 the Euclidean distance formula's upper limit is $n-1$, not $n$ as the vectors are indexed from zero.
- On page 223 there are three instances that should be $17^{12}$ but rendered as $17^{1}2$.
