Prompt:

Here is a description of a simple esoteric programming language called ABC2.  Each command is a single character and characters not corresponding to a command are ignored by the ABC2 interpreter: a - Increment the accumulator
b - Decrement the accumulator
c - Output the accumulator

d - Invert accumulator
r - Set accumulator to a random number between 0 and accumulator
n - Set accumulator to 0

$ - Toggle ASCII output mode.  When on, the c instruction prints the accumulator as an ASCII character.
l - Loop back to the beginning of the program.  Accumulator and ASCII mode does not reset.
    ^   -- toggle active accumulator (A -> B or vice versa)
    k   -- get a character from the keyboard (no echo)
    q   -- quit
    e   -- toggle newline mode
    !   -- push accumulator on the stack
    @   -- pop stack to accumulator
    g   -- branch from current instruction based on TOS
    x   -- swap accumulator and TOS
    ?   -- if TOS false, skip next instruction
    +,-,*,/,%,<,>,=  -- operations on top two stack items
                        result on stack

GPT-4:

The ABC2 language you've described is a stack-based esoteric programming language with commands for manipulating a single accumulator, interacting with a stack, and controlling program flow. Here's a summary of the commands:

    a: Increment the accumulator.
    b: Decrement the accumulator.
    c: Output the accumulator.
    d: Invert accumulator (assuming it switches between 1 and 0 or negates the value).
    r: Set accumulator to a random number between 0 and the current value of the accumulator.
    n: Set accumulator to 0.
    $: Toggle ASCII output mode. When on, the c instruction prints the accumulator as an ASCII character.
    l: Loop back to the beginning of the program. Accumulator and ASCII mode do not reset.
    ^: Toggle active accumulator (A -> B or vice versa, assuming there are two accumulators).
    k: Get a character from the keyboard (no echo).
    q: Quit the program.
    e: Toggle newline mode (assuming this affects output format).
    !: Push accumulator on the stack.
    @: Pop stack to accumulator.
    g: Branch from current instruction based on Top Of Stack (TOS).
    x: Swap accumulator and TOS.
    ?: If TOS is false, skip the next instruction.
    +: Add top two stack items.
    -: Subtract top two stack items.
    *: Multiply top two stack items.
    /: Divide top two stack items.
    %: Modulus of top two stack items.
    <: Less than comparison of top two stack items.
    >: Greater than comparison of top two stack items.
    =: Equality comparison of top two stack items.

The operations +, -, *, /, %, <, >, = will manipulate the top two items on the stack and push the result back onto the stack.

If you have a specific ABC2 program or task you'd like to try or understand, let me know and I can help you interpret or execute it.

Now that I've told you how ABC2 works.  Simulate this program in Python and tell me what it outputs: aaa!aaaaaaaa!*@!!!+@aa!
@!aaaaaaaa!@!aaaaaa!
@!bbb!@!aaaaaaaa!
naaaa!aaaa!*@!!!+
@aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
@!bbb!!bbbbbbb!aaa!
